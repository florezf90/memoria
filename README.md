</div>

### Introducing Memoria: The Protectors, a brand-new Tabletop Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) designed for quick character creation without sacrificing customization. This web application offers a brief game overview, allowing users to swiftly dive into character creation through a seamless sign-up and log-in process. The goal is to streamline the character-building experience, ensuring players spend less time and more time exploring the vast open-world setting. Memoria aims to stand out by providing a balance of speed, customization, and a rich gaming environment, challenging the traditional 1 to 2-hour character creation norm.
